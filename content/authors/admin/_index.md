People predominantly behave in ways that are consistent with their beliefs and values, but increasingly misinformation poses threats to peopleâ€™s capacity to achieve their goals. Misinformation and false beliefs affect a range of domains including vaccine hesitancy, climate change denial, and political engagement, and therefore represents a serious challenge to modern society.

The Misinformation Lab aims to develop and test theories regarding the spread of and vulnerability to false beliefs, as well as developing and evaluating scalable strategies for addressing misinformation in society.

Specifically, we aim to:

* Uncover the factors that contribute to misinformation and false beliefs in society.
* Understand what works in persuasive messages, communicating science and reducing misinformation.
* Augment social psychological intervention capacity in the School of Psychology.
* Promote open, reproducible research practices.
* Champion the value of psychology to everyday life.
