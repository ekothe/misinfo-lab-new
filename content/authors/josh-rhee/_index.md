Josh is a Ph.D. candidate at Melbourne University and was an Associate Research Fellow at the Lab in 2021. Josh's primary research investigates when, how and why everyday non-moral ideas come to gain moral significance, and why such “moralization” might lead to certain patterns of cognition and behaviour. He is particularly interested in looking at moralization as a functional response to cues of threat in a person's environment, and how it may enable people to take action in the face of uncertain information.
