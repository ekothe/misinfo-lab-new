abstract: "Research consistently shows that right‐wing ideological adherents are
  more likely to deny climate change. However, less is known about how
  right‐wing ideological subtypes are uniquely related to climate change denial,
  as well as what explains these relationships. This study examines whether
  threat to the socioeconomic system in the form of climate change mitigation
  policies, referred to as Climate Change Mitigation Threat (CCMT), mediates the
  relationships between Right‐Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance
  Orientation (SDO) subtypes and four forms of climate change denial (existence
  denial, human cause denial, impact denial and climate science denial). U.S.
  participants (N = 334; Mage = 34.70, SD = 5.98) were recruited via Amazon
  MTurk. When shared variance in the predictors was accounted for, we found
  that: (a) Conventionalism (RWA‐C) positively predicted all forms of climate
  change denial; (b) Dominance (SDO‐D) positively predicted existence denial;
  (c) Anti‐Egalitarianism (SDO‐E) positively predicted both human cause and
  impact denial; and (d) Aggression (RWA‐A) negatively predicted existence
  denial. All significant direct relationships were partially mediated by CCMT,
  except for the direct paths between SDO‐D and existence denial, and RWA‐A and
  existence denial. These findings suggest that right‐wing adherents who conform
  to societal norms and prefer unequal social systems may deny climate change
  partly due to a perception that mitigation strategies proposed to combat
  climate change threaten the existing socioeconomic system."
