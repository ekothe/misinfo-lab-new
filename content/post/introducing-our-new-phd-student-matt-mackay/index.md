The good news keeps on rolling, we're thrilled that Matt Mackay [](https://deakin-misinform.slack.com/team/UH04JH894)offered a PhD candidature and scholarship at Deakin, starting at the end of March, 2021. Matt was a fourth year student in the lab in 2019. Once he starts he will be investigating the effectiveness of emotion based messages in climate change over time. 



Welcome back Matt!
