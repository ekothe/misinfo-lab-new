We are extremely excited to announce that our July Seminar Series speaker will be Ben Grodeck who is a PhD student specializing in Experimental and Behavioural Economics. Ben's talk will be entitled ***Demanding the Morally Demanding: Experimental Evidence from Charitable Giving***. We look forward to hearing about Ben's research on whether confronting people with morally demanding statements about charitable giving actually increases their willingness to donate!
