We're really happy to have a new crop of 4th year students joining the lab this week. This year we will have students in the lab working on projects with Mathew Ling, Anna Klas, Kate Barford and Richard Moulding. 

We had an engaging first online lab meeting today and hope that this provides a structure to help all our lab members feel connected in the midst of a very strange year.
