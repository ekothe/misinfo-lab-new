A huge congratulations to the 4th year students at Deakin University who submitted their theses yesterday. 

Conducting a literature search, generating your own hypotheses, learning how to analyse statistics in R, and writing up an entire thesis within a single year, is a challenging prospect at the best of times. It is even more amazing that students achieved this feat in a year that was marked by a global pandemic, lockdowns, and an earthquake! 

We are so incredibly proud of all the 4th year students in our lab, who managed to overcome all of 2021's trials and tribulations, whilst also being wonderfully supportive colleagues, enthusiastic learners and curious researchers!
