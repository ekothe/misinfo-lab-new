Eddie Clarke, Anna Klas, and Emily Kothe will all be heading over to Wellington for SASP2018 in early April.

We will be presenting some hot off the press data related to projects we’ve run over the last 12 months. If you’re coming to SASP we look forward to seeing you there, if not never fear we’ll keep your up to date so you don’t miss out.
