Results are rolling in for some of our 4th year students, so we just want to congratulate everyone on their achievement of completing 4th year in a pandemic (whether they did it through the Misinformation Lab or anywhere else). Finishing 4th year, writing a thesis, etc, this is no small feat. Be proud of yourselves (we know we're proud of you!).
