We are thrilled to announce the winners of our Best 4th Year Student Presentation Award. For the first time, we've awarded joint winners for this award. Congratulations to *Isaac Hayes* and *Grace Watts* for your truly outstanding presentations. 

It's always very hard to pick the winner of this award, and this year it was so hard we couldn't pick just one person!

This award recognises the exceptional quality of Isaac and Grace's communication skills and their understanding of their projects. Excellent work folks!
