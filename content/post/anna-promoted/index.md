The Misinformation Lab is thrilled to congratulated Anna Klas on her promotion 
to Lecturer! Anna initially joined the School of Psychology as a Teaching Scholar, despite this Anna has been incredibly research active. We're so thrilled to have her contributions to the lab (and the wider academic community) formally recognised.

Next stop Senior Lecturer!
