Over the past two weeks our 4th year students have been presenting their thesis progress to the lab.

They did a fantastic job explaining the background to their projects and the plans for the remainder of the year. We were lucky enough to have some other staff members from the School of Psychology come along to see our students present and they were all very impressed with the quality of the work our students are doing.

Great work everyone!
