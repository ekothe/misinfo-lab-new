We're pleased to announce that Anna Klas has been awarded a 2018 Deakin Science and Society Network Establishment Grant. The grant will fund Anna’s attendance at the Australasian Society of Behavioural Medicine Annual Meeting in Christchurch in 2019.

Anna’s attendance at the conference will provide her the opportunity to create collaborative research ideas that combine health and environmental aspects of research into pro-environmental behaviour.
