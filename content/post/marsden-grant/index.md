Dr Mathew Ling and collaborators at Massey University, La Trobe University, Cambridge University, and Philipps-Universit√§t Marburg, have obtained a $360,000 [Marsden Fast Start Grant](https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/marsden/awarded-grants/marsden-fund-awards-2021/#:~:text=Dartmouth%20College-,21%2DMAU%2D043,-EHB) to investigate why New Zealanders fall down the conspiratorial rabbit hole. [Extending on work this collaboration has published this year](https://theconversation.com/was-phar-lap-killed-by-gangsters-new-research-shows-which-conspiracies-people-believe-in-and-why-158610), this grant led by Dr Matt Williams at Massey will take a novel longitudinal approach to this question, integrating qualitative methods and temporal network analysis.
