Our on-campus 4th year students presented the results of their thesis projects at the School of Psychology 4th Year Conference this afternoon. Their work attracted a lot of interest from fellow students from their cohort and School staff.

Weâ€™re exceedingly proud of the work all of our students produced this year, regardless of whether or not they were able to attend the conference in person. Great work!
