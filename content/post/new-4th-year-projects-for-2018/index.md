With 2018 in full swing, Misinformation Lab members have been putting the finishing touches on our offering of 4th-year research projects for 2018. We’ve got an exciting set of projects on offer covering climate change denial, vaccine hesitancy, pro-environmental behaviour, and message framing.

We’re also very excited to be offering structured training in social and health psychology methods for our 4th-year students this year. This will ensure our students gain skills across a number of research methods commonly used within our lab.
