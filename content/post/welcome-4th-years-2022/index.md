Today was our first lab meeting for 2022. This year the Misinformation and Social Behaviour Lab has students studying a broad range of topics including climate change, vaccination, dietary behaviours and utopian thinking. The student profiles will be up on the site soon, but we're thrilled to have such an engaged set of students to kick off the year.
