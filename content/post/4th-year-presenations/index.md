Lab meetings for the past three weeks have been filled with our 4th year students presenting their research plans for the year. 

It's a great opportunity for everyone in the lab to get to know more about what their lab-mates are working on. It's amazing to see how well everyone has got a grasp on their projects (and in some cases entirely new methods and concepts) in such a short period of time. 

Great work everyone!
