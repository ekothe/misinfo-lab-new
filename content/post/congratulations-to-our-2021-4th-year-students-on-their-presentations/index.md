A huge congratulations to all of our billiant 2021 4th year students, who overcame lockdowns, technical issues on Zoom, and a whole bunch of nerves, to completely ace their research project presentations last week! 

Over a three-week extravaganza, the huge variety of research projects in the lab were on full (virtual) display, as our students each presented their research proposals on a range of meaningful and fascinating topics such as: the emotional consequences of goal conflict in the context of pro-environmental behaviours; individual difference constructs related to belief homophily; predictors of willingness to engage in COVID-19 health behaviours; and many more! 

A special congratulations goes out to [Annie Hague](https://www.misinformationlab.com/authors/student-annie-hague/), who was selected as the inargual winner of the Misinformation Lab award for best 4th year presentation! The award was introduced this year to recognise a single student who demonstrated particular excellence in presenting their research proposal. Annie's presentation (entitled: ***Predicting intentions to reduce meat consumption using the theory of planned behaviour***) was selected as the winner by a panel of three Ph.D. students who independently evaluated each presentation on objective criteria including: how effectively the speaker was able to communicate the background, aims, contribution and significance of the research; whether their proposed analysis plan was appropriate in answering their research quesiton; and how engaging they were in their delivery of the presentation. Great job Annie!
