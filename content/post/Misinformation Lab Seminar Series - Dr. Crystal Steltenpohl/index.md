When we think about open science, the term "Qualitative Research" is not exactly the first thing comes to mind. But could this lack of focus on qualitative methods reflect some important gaps in the open science movement? In an insightful Misinformation Seminar series talk, Dr. Crystal Steltenpohl delivered a thought-provoking presentation entitled: ***what the open science movement can learn from qualitative research.*** 

If you are curious about the lessons that open science can take from qualitative research on important topics such as, exploration, diversity, positionality, dangerous defaults, and ethics - feel free to watch the recording of Dr. Steltenpohl's talk below!
