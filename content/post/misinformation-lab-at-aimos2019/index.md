The inaugural meeting of the Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-Research and Open Science was held at the University of Melbourne last week and the Misinformation Lab was lucky to be there in force with Rebbekah McDonald Neale, Matt Mackay, Emily Kothe, Anna Klas and Mathew Ling.

Rebbekah McDonald Neale presented a poster presentation work she completed in her 4th year thesis in collaboration with Amy Wanschers. Amy and Bek’s work “How do participants want their data handled: does data sensitivity or data type matter?” was very well received and sparked lively conversations during the poster session.

Mathew Ling led an unconference session “Supporting the modernisation of research practices: Efficiency, Scalability, Openness” that included contributions from Monash’s Data Fluency, UniMelb’’’s Research Platform Services, and ANZORN.

The conference was also a great opportunity for us to meet with some of our outstanding collaborators (including lab alum Andy Head!) and hear from exciting voices and perspectives from across open science and meta-research. Bring on AIMOS2020!
