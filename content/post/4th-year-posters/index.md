Our 4th year students recently had the chance to present their exciting research at the 2021 Deakin Psychology Poster Conference. It was fantastic to see the various elements of our 4th years' research projects come together in poster form. It was also wonderful to see the broad range of research topics that were covered by the 4th year psychology students at Deakin this year. Special shoutout to our very own [Emily Dwyer](https://www.misinformationlab.com/authors/student-emily-dwyer/) who received an honourable mention for this fantasitc poster on predictors of COVID-19 vaccine intentions.
