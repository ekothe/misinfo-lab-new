The Deakin University School of Psychology awards a prize for the Best PhD Publication every year. We're thrilled to congratulate Misinformation and Social Behaviour Lab PhD student, Maddie North, as the winner of the 2021 prize for her publication 'North, M., Kothe, E., Klas, A., & Ling, M. (2021). How to define “Vegan”: An exploratory study of definition preferences among omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans. *Food Quality and Preference*, 93, 104246'.

This paper was truly a labour of love for Maddie, who analysed qualitative and quantitatve data from 230 vegans, 117 omnivores and 43 vegetarians to understand how people understand the term "vegan". 

Congratulations Maddie, this recognition of your work is well deserved!
