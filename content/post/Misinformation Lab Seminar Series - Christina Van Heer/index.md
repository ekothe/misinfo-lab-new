In our May 2021 series talk, we were joined by the brilliant **Christina Van Heer** (aka CVH). Chris gave a talk on how her research has applied mathematical modelling to make sense of the way people update their predictions in changing environments. The talk not only provided some fascinating insights into how people learn in particular contexts, but also included an approachable breakdown of how statistical models can be used to systematically make sense of cognitive processes underlying observable behaviours. 

The title of Chris' talk was: *Local versus global optimisation of error in probabilistic learning*

The Misinformation Lab Seminar Series is a monthly event open to all members and friends of the lab. The seminar series is primarily motivated by a shared curiosity about the myriad of awesome perspectives and insights out there on information processing, behaviour change, open science, and promoting social progress. Our aim is to invite speakers from a diverse range of interests, lived-experiences, and research backgrounds to deliver their insights and perspectives on topics that they are excited about! The series also aims to provide our Psychology students at the undergraduate level to with the opportunity to hear, and engage with, talks by real-world researchers.

Whether you are a seasoned academic, Ph.D Student, or working in Industry - if you are interested in giving a Seminar Series talk, we would love to [hear from you!](mailto:josh.rhee@deakin.edu.au)
