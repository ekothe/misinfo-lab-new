Congratulations to Eddie Clarke on formally graduating his PhD today.

Dr Clarke’s thesis *“Climate Change Denial: The Effects of Ideological Polarisation and Threat”* used system justification theory and political ideology to understand sub-types of climate change denial.

We’re very happy to welcome Dr Clarke to the academy and look forward to working with him for years to come.
