The Misinformation Lab had our first lab meeting of 2021 today and we were thrilled (as always) to meet our newest lab members. Our current students (and the projects they'll be working on) are listed on the main page of our website.

Some interesting tidbits about our 2021 cohort. We have students from across the country (and one about to move to the US and continue her studies remotely!). Some of our students from Deakin and and some joining us from other institutions. We have students who came straight to a psychology degree from high school and others who have had careers doing other things (we have a nurse, a social media strategist,  and an electrician!). Here is to a great 2021!
